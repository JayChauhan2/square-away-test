Here are the notes formatted for clarity and logical understanding:

**Weight Experienced by the Body**

---

**Law of Floatation**
A body floats in liquid if the weight of the liquid displaced by the immersed portion of the body is equal to the total weight of the body.

---

**Forces Acting on a Body Immersed (Partially or Wholly) in Liquid:**
There are two primary forces:
1.  **Upward Thrust (Buoyancy):**
    *   Acts at the center of buoyancy.
    *   Its magnitude is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced.
2.  **Weight of the Body:**
    *   Acts vertically downwards.
    *   Acts through its center of gravity.

**Conditions Based on Weight (W) vs. Upward Thrust (T):**

*   **When W > T (Upward Thrust):**
    *   The body will sink in the liquid.

*   **When W = T:**
    *   The body will remain in equilibrium, fully submerged but stationary, inside the liquid.

*   **When W < T:**
    *   The body will come up to the surface of the liquid and float.
    *   In this floating state, the body will adjust its immersion such that the weight of the liquid displaced by its immersed portion becomes equal to the total weight of the body.

**Additional Note:**
Unsure with: rotation & oscillation.
